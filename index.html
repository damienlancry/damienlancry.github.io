<h2>Welcome to my projects portfolio!</h2>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;line-height: 1.6 !important;margin-bottom: 5em;">
    Here is a list of different projects I have worked on, all related to Data Science as a whole. You will therefore find projects on Data Analysis, Data Visualization, as well as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and even Natural Language Processing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some are projects I have realized during my studies as part of a class, but most are personal projects on which I have worked on using ideas and examples from online projects, or personal ideas.
    <br>
    <br>
    This page is above all a personal reference point that allows me to keep track of the different things I have worked on znd group them together. Each of them refers to a Github repo, so feel free to take a look around, and use all the resources available for your own projects! ðŸ™‚
