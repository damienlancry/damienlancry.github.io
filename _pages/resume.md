# About me

>### Graduate student in Data Science looking for a 6-month internship starting February 2019

[pdf](../assets/pdf/CV_Eliott_Joulot.pdf){: .btn .btn--info}
<br><br>
I am a 23 years old master’s student in Computer Science at CPE Lyon, currently doing a master in Data Science at EPFL as an exchange student. I am looking for an internship ideally in the field of Data Analysis and Machine Learning from February 2019.

I have gained good technical leadership from my studies and experiences, as well as the ability to adapt easily and communicate ideas clearly to overcome new challenges.

Most importantly, I love understanding others' points of view and working in diverse teams towards ambitious objectives and get new perspectives from it.

At the end of the day, I’m happy as long as I keep on learning.

Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliottjoulot/), or reach out over email at eliott.joulot@epfl.ch
